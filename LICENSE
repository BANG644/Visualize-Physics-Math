GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the License clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the License requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in case a program is used to provide services to users over a network, the complete source code of the program is made available to the users of that network service. Therefore, this License applies to software that runs on servers and is made available for use over a network.

We use the GNU General Public License version 3 as a base for the GNU Affero General Public License. The two licenses are identical except for an additional requirement in section 13: if you run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must make the source code of the modified version available to those users.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
“You” refers to the licensee.
“Source Code” means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

1. Source Code.
The Program must be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, provided that you license the entire work under this License and do not add additional restrictions.

6. Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

7. Additional Terms.
Additional permissions may be added to this License as exceptions; additional terms may be added as requirements that strengthen copyleft.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy of the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and propagate that work.

11. Patents.
A contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims.

12. No Warranty.
There is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full license text is found.
